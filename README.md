# Purpose
As a seasoned Information Technology professional, this repo is where I intend to keep everything I create or find useful. 
#
**YAML**
These are templates that I have created in order to save myself some time. 
<ul>Take them for yourself. They're plug and play</ul>
<ul>Email me with suggestions on how to improve them</ul>

**PowerShell**
These are specific use case scripts I've written
<ul>Would you add these to your toolkit</ul>
<ul>I'd love to see yours too</ul>

**Python**
These are neat things I've created
<ul>I'd love to hear feedback</ul>
<ul>I'll continue to update as I add more</ul>
